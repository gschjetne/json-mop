## Introduction

JSON-MOP is a small library aiming to cut down time spent moving data
between CLOS and JSON objects. It depends on
[YASON](https://github.com/hanshuebner/yason) and it should be
possible to use it alongside straight calls to functions from YASON.

## Quick Start

To use JSON-MOP, define your classes with the class option
`(:metaclass json-serializable-class)`. For slots that you want to appear in
the JSON representation of your class, add the slot option `:json-key`
with the string to use as the attribute name. The option `:json-type`
defaults to `:any`, but you can control how each slot value is
transformed to and from JSON with one of the following:

### JSON type specifiers

Type          | Remarks
--------------|--------------------------------------------
`:any`        | Guesses the way to encode and decode the value 
`:string`     | Enforces a string value
`:number`     | Enforces a number value
`:integer`    | Enforces a integer value
`:hash-table` | Enforces a hash table value
`:vector`     | Enforces a vector value
`:list`       | Enforces a list value
`:bool`       | Maps `T` and `NIL` with `true` and `false`
`<symbol>`    | Uses a `(:metaclass json-serializable-class)` class definition to direct the transformation of the value

### Homogeneous sequences and objects

In addition, the type specifier may be a list of two elements, first
element is one of `:list`, `:vector`, `:hash-table`; the second is any JSON type
specifier that is to be applied to the elements of the list or the values of the hash-table.

### NIL and null semantics

JSON `null` is treated as an unbound slot in CLOS. Unbound slots are
ignored when encoding objects, unless `*encode-unbound-slots*` is
bound to `T`, in which case they are represented as JSON `null`.

Slots bound to `NIL` with JSON types other `:bool` will signal an
error, but this may change in the future.

### Encoding and decoding JSON

Turning an object into JSON is done with the `yason:encode` generic
function. Turning it back into an object is slightly more involved,
using `json-to-clos` on a stream, string or hash table; a class name;
and optional initargs for the class. Values decoded from the JSON will
override values specified in the initargs.

### Example

First, define your classes:

```lisp
(defclass book ()
  ((title :initarg :title
          :json-type :string
          :json-key "title")
   (published-year :initarg :year
         :json-type :number
         :json-key "year_published")
   (fiction :initarg :fiction
            :json-type :bool
            :json-key "is_fiction"))
  (:metaclass json-serializable-class))

(defclass author ()
  ((name :initarg :name
         :json-type :string
         :json-key "name")
   (birth-year :initarg :year
               :json-type :number
               :json-key "year_birth")
   (bibliography :initarg :bibliography
                 :json-type (:list book)
                 :json-key "bibliography"))
  (:metaclass json-serializable-class))
```

Let's try creating an instance:

```lisp
(defparameter *author*
  (make-instance 'author
                 :name "Mark Twain"
                 :year 1835
                 :bibliography
                 (list
                  (make-instance 'book
                                 :title "The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today"
                                 :year 1873
                                 :fiction t)
                  (make-instance 'book
                                 :title "Life on the Mississippi"
                                 :year 1883
                                 :fiction nil)
                  (make-instance 'book
                                 :title "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"
                                 :year 1884
                                 :fiction t))))
```

To turn it into JSON, `encode` it:

```lisp
(encode *author*)
```

This will print the following:

```javascript
{"name":"Mark Twain","year_birth":1835,"bibliography":[{"title":"The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today","year_published":1873,"is_fiction":true},{"title":"Life on the Mississippi","year_published":1883,"is_fiction":false},{"title":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn","year_published":1884,"is_fiction":true}]}
```

The same can be turned back into a CLOS object with `(json-to-clos input 'author)`
